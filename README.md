# MD_RDM
Pytorch implementation of 'Monocular Depth Estimation Using Relative Depth Maps'

## TODO

* (tested) - element has been tested in conjunction with other network parts
* (tested on its own) - element has been tested by manualy feeding input directly into it but not in conjuction with the rest of the network

- [x] Encoder structure (tested)
- [x] Decoder DenseBlocks (tested)
- [x] Decoder WSM-Blocks (tested)
- [x] Decoder DORN-Blocks (tested)
- [x] Relative depth pair estimation (tested)
- [x] Lloyd Quantization of depth pairs (tested)
- [x] ALS depth map reconstruction (tested on its own)
- [ ] Depth Map Decomposition
- [ ] Optimal Map Reconstruction
- [ ] Training cycle
- [ ] Dataloaders + Augmentation
- [ ] Training
